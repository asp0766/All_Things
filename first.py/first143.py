# why Use NumPy ? 
# NumPy provides efficent storage
# it also provides better ways of handling data for processing
# it is fast 
# it is easy to learn 
# NumPy uses relatievly less memory to store data 



import numpy as np
myarr = np.array([3,6,32,7], np.int8)
print(myarr)
print(myarr[0])  # print the vlsue according to indexing value 

myarr1 = np.array([[2,3,4,5]])  # 2D array
myarr1[0][1] = 34
print(myarr1)  # change 3 into 34
