// String Literals
// String literals in JavaScript are sequences of characters enclosed within single ('') or double ("") quotation marks. These literals allow us to represent textual data within our code

let myName = "Mayank Pandey!";
let message = 'JavaScript is a scripting language.';



// Concatenation of strings
let firstName = "Mayank";
let lastName = "Pandey";
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

console.log(fullName);
