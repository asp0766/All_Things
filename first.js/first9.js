//  Comparison Operators


// Strict equality is denoted by '==='. When we use strict equality operator, both the data-type and the value are checked to determine equality, and it returns a boolean answer.

let x =10 , y =10.0 ;
console.log(x === y);


// Loose equality is denoted by '=='. When we use loose equality operator, only the value is checked to determine equality, and it returns a boolean answer.

console.log(x == y);
